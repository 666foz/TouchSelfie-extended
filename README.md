# TouchSelfie
Open Source Photobooth based on the official Raspberry Pi 7" Touchscreen

## Changes from wyolum/TouchSelfie

- Added GPIO hardware interface for three buttons (with connections in hardware/ directory). Each button triggers a different effect

- Added "Animation" effect that produces animated gifs (needs imagemagick)

- preview now uses builtin annotate_text and opaque preview
